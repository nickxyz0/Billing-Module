# Billing-Module
Billing Module Project - Python

This was a semester long project in our python class. We were assigned to groups of 4, and worked part by part on creating a fully functional Billing module from scrath.

This module includes:
- AdHoc Reports
- The Ability to record Multiple Employees information
- Writing data from the console input to a .txt file
- Working menus to naviagate through.

Skills I learned from this project:
-Team work and team building, something necessary in jobs requiring coding work
-In depth python coding
- The use of many different python functions like file writing and modules.
